In a short time, industry had to deal with new plans and protocols in order to reduce the risk of exposure to the coronavirus ensuring that employees remain healthy. This meant introducing distancing measures, updating Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) requirements, wiping down surfaces and equipment on a regular basis and adapting delivery procedures. In addition to issues that are affecting all businesses, food industry has and will have additional challenges to deal with. People will always need to eat and so safe, high quality food must still be produced and provided to customers.</p><p class="rfont" style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0.75em; font-family: NexusSerif; line-height: 28px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 20px; text-align: justify; font-weight: 400; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">Food safety represents the primary concern of all manufacturers, but this should now encompass actions to slow down, as much as possible, the spread of the coronavirus. Even though there is no evidence that the virus can be transmitted via food or food packaging, there is evidence that it can remain viable on certain surfaces for a longer period. The present paper reports a brief review on how the profitable combination of computer science and information technology can help shape the future of food safety.</p><p class="rfont" style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0.75em; font-family: NexusSerif; line-height: 28px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 20px; text-align: justify; font-weight: 400; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">The literature review has been conducted by considering scientific contributions and official resources published by the main international governmental organizations and technical institutions. Some of the cited sources include World Health Organization (WHO), Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), International Telecommunication Union (ITU) and the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE). As the COVID-19 pandemic is unprecedented and still ongoing around the world to date, the literature review was limited to contributions published no more than two years ago.</p><p class="rfont" style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0.75em; font-family: NexusSerif; line-height: 28px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 20px; text-align: justify; font-weight: 400; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">Information and communication technology (ICT) and computer science applications are already present in industry. Despite this, the challenges the world will have to face in the next future to stem the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic require further interdisciplinary and synergistic efforts. In this framework, technology can play a key role in help shaping the future of industry and food safety in particular.</p><p class="rfont" style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0.75em; font-family: NexusSerif; line-height: 28px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 20px; text-align: justify; font-weight: 400; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">WHO declared COVID-19 disease a public health emergency of international concern on 2020, January 30. The 2020 edition of the Global Report on Food Crises (GRFC) [, published on 2020, April 20 as the result of a joint, consensus-based assessment of acute food insecurity situations around the world, describes the worldwide scale of acute hunger. GRFC-2020 provides an analysis of the drivers that are contributing to food crises across the globe, and examines how the COVID-19 pandemic might contribute to their perpetuation or deterioration. When comparing the 50 countries taken into account in both the 2019 and the 2020 reports, the population in crisis rose from 112 to 123 million. This reflected worsening acute food insecurity in key conflict-driven crises and the growing severity of drought and economic shocks. Around 183 million people in 47 countries were classified in stressed conditions, at risk of slipping into crisis or worse. As stated by Antonio Guterres, Secretary-General of the United Nations (UN) and reported on GRFC-2020&nbsp;, the upheaval that has been set in motion by the COVID-19 pandemic may push even more families and communities into deeper distress.The COVID-19 disease is having an unprecedented worldwide impact in health and socioeconomic terms; according to data provided by Johns Hopkins University , by 2020, September 21, the number of global cases passed 31 million with more than 960,000 deaths. Furthermore, the pandemic is certainly having an unprecedented impact also on food systems. This is what ITU, the United Nationsâ€™ specialized agency for ICT, reported on its online resource ITU News .</p><p><br></p></div>
